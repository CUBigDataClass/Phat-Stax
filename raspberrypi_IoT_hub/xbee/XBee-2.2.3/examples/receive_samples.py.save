This example continuously reads the serial port and processes IO data
received from a remote XBee.
import zigbee
import serial
import pprint

PORT = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
BAUD_RATE = 9600

# Open serial port
ser = serial.Serial(PORT, BAUD_RATE)

# Create API object
xbee1 = Xbee.zigbee.ZigBee(ser)
#xbee1 = XBee.zigbee.Zigbee(PORT)
print "hello"
# Continuously read and print packets
while True:
    try:
	print "still here"
        response = xbee1.wait_read_frame()
        
	pprint.pprint(response)
	print "wtf happened"
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        break
        
ser.close()
